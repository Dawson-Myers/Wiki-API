# Wiki-API
First RESTful API creation

This was created during my Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp ran by App Brewery through Udemy.
- This is an example of a RESTful API created for storing articles and pulling articles of information easily and efficiently.

- View the webpage screenshots folder for a complete view of the database page.

- First start the app by using hyper.
- navigate to the folder where the app is stored
- type in node app.js or nodemon app.js if you have nodemon
- In a google chrome browser tab go to localhost:3000

- In a new tab in Hyper you will need to type in mongod then hit enter.
- This will start the database so that you can Create, Edit, or Delete entries.

- In another new Hyper tab you can enter mongo and hit enter in order to pull up the database command line where you can navigate the entries.
